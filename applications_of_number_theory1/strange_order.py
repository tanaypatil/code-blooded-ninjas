Given an integer n . Initially you have permutation p of size n : p[i] = i . To build new array a from p following steps are done while permutation p is not empty:
Choose maximum existing element in p and define it as x ; Choose all such y in p that gcd ( x , y ) â‰  1 ; Add all chosen numbers into array a in decreasing order and remove them from permutation. Your task is to find a after p became empty.
Note: gcd ( a , b ) is the greatest common divisor of integers a and b .
