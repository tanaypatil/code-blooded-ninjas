Given 2 strings of S1 and S2 with lengths m and n respectively, find the length of longest common subsequence.
A subsequence of a string S whose length is n, is a string containing characters in same relative order as they are present in S, but not necessarily contiguous. Subsequences contain all the strings of length varying from 0 to n. E.g. subsequences of string "abc" are - "",a,b,c,ab,bc,ac,abc.
